## SimpleJekyll
This challenge tests your ability to - using a mock as a guide - build a simple, responsive website. Please code your solution as if it were for production, meaning use sane spacing and indentation, comments when necessary, and best practices for web.

## Instructions
1. Using the mocks found in the `assets/mocks` folder as a guide, implement the necessary HTML and SASS to generate the wireframe.

## Running the Server
At Morgan & Morgan, we build many of our sites using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) framework. As such, this challenge is skeletoned as a Jekyll project. After installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the built-in development server with:

```
jekyll serve
```

After which you'll be able to view the site at `localhost:4000`.

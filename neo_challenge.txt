NASA hosts a Near Earth Orbit Web Service ("NeoWs") that provides paginated data on Asteroids in Near Earth Orbit.

Using the API key "DEMO_KEY", retrieve the first page of tracked asteroids in Near Earth Orbit, sort them by a given metric and output a table to console.  You may use the programming language of your choice.

API route: https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/browse?api_key=DEMO_KEY

Easy metrics:
  "estimated_diameter_max (kilometers), greatest first"
  "absolute_magnitude_h"
Harder metrics:
  "most recent close_approach_date"
  "most recent close_approach miss_distance (miles)"

Bonus points:
  Display the orbiting body and whether it's potentially hazardous

Notes:
  - If given as a longer challenge, maybe display in a table with links to the individual asteroids' API data (see dataset).
  - Or alternatively, plot the sorted distances on a graph (especially if this is a JavaScript/web challenge).
  - DEMO_KEY only allows 30 requests per hour or 50 per day (per IP).

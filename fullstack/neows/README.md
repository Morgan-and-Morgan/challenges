# NeoWs
## NASA Near Earth Orbit Web Service Challenge

NASA hosts a RESTful Near Earth Orbit Web Service ("NeoWs") service that provides data on Asteroids in Near Earth Orbit.

Documentation is available [here](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS).

For the purposes of this challenge, please use the DEMO_KEY api key.  _There are fairly strict request limits for this key, so be mindful of this in your solution_.

### The Challenge

Browsing the overall data-set, please retrieve just the first page of results.

Please sort this data-set by the miss distanance in miles of the most recent close approach date, nearest first.

Output to console the sorted list, displaying the asteroid's name, the miss distance and whether the asteroid is potentially hazardous.

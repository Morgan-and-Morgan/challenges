## NYC Taxi Targeting
We've just learned about a new potential case type. People are being hurt after exiting yellow cabs due to an issue with the placement of the springs in the doors. Now, we need to find class reps and we need to find them quick.

## Problem
The problem is, when and where should we run ads? When choosing locations and timing, we want to optimize for volume. Meaning, we want to target the places and times when people are exiting taxis so we can blast. Using the data provided by the [nyc.gov](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/technology/raw_data.shtml) site, make a recommendation for the top 5 places (by cross street or landmark) for media buys. Make sure to support your analysis with data-backed assertions.

## Bonus
1. Taking it a step further, if we could tie individual trips to riders, we can add those individuals to a targeting list, greatly increasing the performance of our buys. Can you think of any ways to do this? If you implement it, extra brownie points.

2. Sometimes seeing the data helps drive business decisions. Can you augment your solution above with a heatmap, gradiated by the attractiveness of geo's at specified times?
